				<h5>Simple and straightforward</h5>
				There's no need to know anything about DDoS to start using our service. We know we ourselves don't! That's why only HTTP is supported, and in a very simplistic mode. That makes our order UI extremely easy to use, though. <a href="/order">Give it a try!</a>
			</div>
			<div class="col-6 p-3">
				<h5>Flexible pricing</h5>
				You only pay a fixed cost per node per minute. Before you ask how much is one node, ask yourself something else: do you care? If not, look no further — you and our service are made for each other!

				<h5>Absolutely legal</h5>
				Or is it? Well, there haven't been any repercussions yet, so it must be! It's not like we have a lawyer or anything. Lawyers are for those who don't know how to not get caught. Use Tor through VPN, make sure all yout credit cards are stolen, and it'll probably be fine.
			</div>
			<div class="col-6 p-3">
				<h5>Extremely scalable</h5>
				Your DDoS was fine, but still fell short of achieving your goals? Good news: we can ramp up the amount of traffic as long as you have the money for it! And also as long as our cloud hosting provider has the patience to put up with us, heh.
